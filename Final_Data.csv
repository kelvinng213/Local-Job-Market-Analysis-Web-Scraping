As part of their plans to strengthen their Hong Kong office this progressive international law firm is looking for a ‘next-generation’ partner to join their
 modest but profitable real estate team in Hong Kong. 


You are a commercial real estate
counsel or junior partner at an international law firm with ambitions to accelerate their career and eventually head up a reputable regional commercial property practice of their own. In particular, our client is most interested
 in lawyers who act for a broad range of developers, landlords and tenants as well as investors, who can demonstrate a successful career in acting on commercial, industrial and residential developments. 


You should be able to
demonstrate your expertise in all real estate related transactions, from the sale and purchase of real estate (including tender, public auctions, private treaties and acquisitions), advising on landlord and tenant issues, to advising on joint
 venture developments, partnerships and property finance transactions. Further, you will help nurture a team that will provide increasing amounts of corporate support (fee earning and business development). 


There is a real aim to invest in people who want to build a regional practice and portfolio allowing people to progress within the firm
 up to Partnership. Yet this opportunity goes one better, with the prospect of joining this firm as a partner 'straight off the bat' and to ultimately succeed the incumbent as head of the practice. In addition, their comprehensive benefits package and competitive
 discretionary bonus scheme rounds off an altogether highly attractive proposition. 


Why this firm?

Time and again, new joiners love the friendly and
collaborative ethos of this firm, which is evident through the partners being very supportive of their fellow partners and all associates, and encouraging group and individual collaboration on business development and networking initiatives.
 Furthermore, the partners genuinely enjoy being 'hands on' to assist in 
training and providing advice to complex legal and business questions, ensuring their team are trained up to be the very best in their chosen specialist field.


Requirements
You are a (real estate) counsel or junior level partner at a major law firm in Hong Kong, in addition to being Hong Kong qualified with a burgeoning client
 base of your own, and strong technical ability in real estate law. You will already have started to map out how you would grow your base into a substantial regional business with the backing of a world renowned international law firm and a small team of associates
 and paralegals. And above all you have the entrepreneurial flair and confidence to realise your ambitions and to nurture the next crop of lawyers in the team. Excellent written and spoken English is essential for this role whilst Chinese would be a bonus. 


To apply, please send your CV to Chris Tang on the link to this job, or for a confidential discussion, please call him on
